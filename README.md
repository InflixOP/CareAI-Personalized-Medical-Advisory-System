## Overview
The Health Care Center project is a web application designed to assist users in diagnosing potential health issues based on their symptoms. Using machine learning algorithms, the application predicts possible diseases and provides relevant information such as descriptions, precautions, medications, workouts, and diets.

This application features a speech recognition interface to facilitate symptom input and dynamic content display based on predictions.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Start speech recognition to input symptoms directly into the form.
- **Disease Prediction**: Get predictions for possible diseases based on input symptoms.
- **Dynamic Results Display**: View detailed information about the predicted disease, including:
